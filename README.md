# Community Code Project

## About My Community

I picked the DEV community to engage with their JavaScript community. I've been happy with my choice, as it has proven to be a place where I have been able to find useful information about topics I am interested in JavaScript, as well as other programming languages like Kotlin or Python. I have built a website for my podcast, called Inside the Minds Podcast. One of my intentions of joining the DEV community was to search their resorces to find ways that I could imporve my website's HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding. Through trial and error, I was able to find some JavaScript code that I could implement on my website. I also found some code that I was not able to implement on my site. Not because it was bad code, or faulty code, but more so because of how I coded my website.
