# Community Code Project

## About My Community

I picked the DEV community to engage with their JavaScript community. I've been happy with my choice, as it has proven to be a place where I have been able to find useful information about topics I am interested in JavaScript, as well as other programming languages like Kotlin or Python. I have built a website for my podcast, called Inside the Minds Podcast. One of my intentions of joining the DEV community was to search their resorces to find ways that I could imporve my website's HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding. Through trial and error, I was able to find some JavaScript code that I could implement on my website. I also found some code that I was not able to implement on my site. Not because it was bad code, or faulty code, but more so because of how I coded my website. 

## Code I was able to use
After searching through some ideas, I found some code that allowed me to switch between a light and dark mode in the body of my website. This change works on a toggle switch that is below my navigation, near the top left of the screen. The "light" color is orange, and the "dark" color is a shade of black. I chose these colors because these are the colors of my website. I like how this turned out, although I am not sure that I will keep it. <br>
Here is the HTML for the toggle switch
